#### Notes
- Sentences longer than 512 characters are truncated to avoid errors.
- Input files must be plain text files with one sentence per line.
- The tool uses the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model from Hugging Face for sentiment analysis.

### Next Steps
- Add a simple web interface for the tool (coming in Phase 4).
- Explore integration with other input formats like CSV files.
